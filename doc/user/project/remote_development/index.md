# Remote Development **(FREE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/95169) in GitLab 15.4 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `vscode_web_ide`. Disabled by default.

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is not available. To make it available, ask an administrator to [enable the feature flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `vscode_web_ide`. On GitLab.com, this feature is available. The feature is not ready for production use.

WARNING:
This feature is in [Alpha](../../../policy/alpha-beta-support.md#alpha-features) and subject to change without notice.

You can use the [Web IDE](../web_ide/index.md) to commit changes to a project directly from your web browser without installing any dependencies or cloning any repositories. The Web IDE, however, lacks a native runtime environment on which you would compile code, run tests, or generate real-time feedback in the IDE. For a more complete IDE experience, you can pair the [Web IDE Beta](../web_ide_beta/index.md) with a Remote Development environment that has been properly configured to run as a host.

## Connect a remote machine to the Web IDE

Prerequisites:

- A remote virtual machine with root access
- A domain address resolving to that machine
- Docker installation

To connect a remote machine to the Web IDE, you must:

1. [Generate Let's Encrypt certificates](#generate-lets-encrypt-certificates).
1. [Connect a development environment to the Web IDE](#connect-a-development-environment-to-the-web-ide).

### Generate Let's Encrypt certificates

To generate Let's Encrypt certificates:

1. [Point a domain to your remote machine](#point-a-domain-to-your-remote-machine).
1. [Install Certbot](#install-certbot).
1. [Generate the certificates](#generate-the-certificates).

#### Point a domain to your remote machine

To point a domain to your remote machine, create an `A` record from `example.remote.gitlab.dev` to `1.2.3.4`.

#### Install Certbot

[Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is a free and open-source software tool that automatically uses Let's Encrypt certificates on manually administered websites to enable HTTPS.

To install Certbot, run the following command:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot
```

#### Generate the certificates

```shell
export EMAIL="YOUR_EMAIL@example.com"
export DOMAIN="example.remote.gitlab.dev"

certbot -d "${DOMAIN}" \
  -m "${EMAIL}" \
  --config-dir ~/.certbot/config \
  --logs-dir ~/.certbot/logs \
  --work-dir ~/.certbot/work \
  --manual \
  --preferred-challenges dns certonly
```

### Connect a development environment to the Web IDE

To connect a development environment to the Web IDE:

1. [Create a development environment](#manage-a-development-environment).
1. [Fetch a token](#fetch-a-token).
1. [Configure a remote connection](#configure-a-remote-connection).

#### Manage a development environment

**Create a development environment**

```shell
export CERTS_DIR="/home/ubuntu/.certbot/config/live/${DOMAIN}"
export PROJECTS_DIR="/home/ubuntu"

docker run -d \
  --name my-environment \
  -p 3443:3443 \
  -v "${CERTS_DIR}/fullchain.pem:/gitlab-rd-web-ide/certs/fullchain.pem" \
  -v "${CERTS_DIR}/privkey.pem:/gitlab-rd-web-ide/certs/privkey.pem" \
  -v "${PROJECTS_DIR}:/projects" \
  registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/create-stage/editor-poc/remote-development/gitlab-rd-web-ide-docker:0.1-alpha \
  --log-level warn --domain "${DOMAIN}" --ignore-version-mismatch
```

The new development environment starts automatically.

**Stop a development environment**

```shell
docker container stop my-environment
```

**Start a development environment**

```shell
docker container start my-environment
```

The token changes every time you restart the development environment.

**Remove a development environment**

To remove a development environment:

1. Stop the development environment.
1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   docker container rm my-environment
   ```

#### Fetch a token

```shell
docker exec my-environment cat TOKEN
```

#### Configure a remote connection

To configure a remote connection from the Web IDE:

1. Open the Web IDE.
1. In the Menu Bar, select **View > Terminal** or press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd>.
1. In the terminal panel, select **Configure a remote connection**.
1. Enter the URL for the remote host including the port (for example, `yourdomain.com:3443`).
1. Enter the project path.
1. Enter the [token you fetched](#fetch-a-token).

Alternatively, you can pass the parameters from a URL and connect directly to the Web IDE:

1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   echo "https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-web-ide?remoteHost=${DOMAIN}:3443&hostPath=/projects"
   ```

1. Go to that URL and enter the [token you fetched](#fetch-a-token).
