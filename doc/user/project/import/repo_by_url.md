# Import project from repository by URL **(FREE)**

Prerequisite:

- At least the Maintainer role on the destination group to import to. Using the Developer role for this purpose was
  [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387891) in GitLab 15.8 and will be removed in GitLab 16.0.

You can import your existing repositories by providing the Git URL:

1. In GitLab, on the top bar, select **Main menu > Projects > View all projects**.
1. On the right of the page, select **New project**.
1. Select the **Import project** tab.
1. Select **Repository by URL**.
1. Enter a **Git repository URL**.
1. Complete the remaining fields.
1. Select **Create project**.

Your newly created project is displayed.
