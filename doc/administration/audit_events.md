# Audit events **(PREMIUM)**

Use audit events to track important events, including who performed the related action and when.
You can use audit events to track, for example:

- Who changed the permission level of a particular user for a GitLab project, and when.
- Who added a new user or removed a user, and when.

Audit events are similar to the [log system](logs/index.md).

The GitLab API, database, and `audit_json.log` record many audit events. Some audit events are only available through
[streaming audit events](audit_event_streaming.md).

You can also generate an [audit report](audit_reports.md) of audit events.

NOTE:
You can't configure a retention policy for audit events, but epic
[7917](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7917) proposes to change this.

## Time zones

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/242014) in GitLab 15.7, GitLab UI shows dates and times in the user's local time zone instead of UTC.

The time zone used for audit events depends on where you view them:

- In GitLab UI, your local time zone (GitLab 15.7 and later) or UTC (GitLab 15.6 and earlier) is used.
- The [Audit Events API](../api/audit_events.md) returns dates and times in UTC by default, or the
  [configured time zone](timezone.md) on a self-managed GitLab instance.
- In `audit_json.log`, UTC is used.
- In CSV exports, UTC is used.

## View audit events

Depending on the events you want to view, at a minimum you must have:

- For group audit events of all users in the group, the Owner role for the group.
- For project audit events of all users in the project, the Maintainer role for the project.
- For group and project audit events based on your own actions, the Developer role for the group or project.
- [Auditor users](auditor_users.md) can see group and project events for all users.

You can view audit events scoped to a group or project.

To view a group's audit events:

1. Go to the group.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Security & Compliance > Audit Events**.

Group events do not include project audit events. Group events can also be accessed using the
[Group Audit Events API](../api/audit_events.md#group-audit-events). Group event queries are limited to a maximum of 30
days.

To view a project's audit events:

1. Go to the project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Security & Compliance > Audit Events**.

Project events can also be accessed using the [Project Audit Events API](../api/audit_events.md#project-audit-events).
Project event queries are limited to a maximum of 30 days.

## View instance audit events **(PREMIUM SELF)**

You can view audit events from user actions across an entire GitLab instance.

To view instance audit events:

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Monitoring > Audit Events**.

### Export to CSV

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1449) in GitLab 13.4.
> - [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285441) in GitLab 13.7.

You can export the current view (including filters) of your instance audit events as a CSV file. To export the instance
audit events to CSV:

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Monitoring > Audit Events**.
1. Select the available search [filters](#filter-audit-events).
1. Select **Export as CSV**.

The exported file:

- Is sorted by `created_at` in ascending order.
- Is limited to a maximum of 100 000 events. The remaining records are truncated when this limit is reached.

Data is encoded with:

- Comma as the column delimiter.
- `"` to quote fields if necessary.
- New lines separate rows.

The first row contains the headers, which are listed in the following table along with a description of the values:

| Column               | Description                                        |

| **Entity Path**      | Path of the scope.                                 |
| **Target ID**        | ID of the target.                                  |
| **Target Type**      | Type of the target.                                |

Successful sign-in events are the only audit events available at all tiers. To see successful sign-in events:

1. Select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile > Authentication log**.

After upgrading to a paid tier, you can see also see successful sign-in events on audit event pages.

## Filter audit events

From audit events pages, different filters are available depending on the page you're on.

| Audit event page | Available filter                                                                                                       |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project          | User (member of the project) who performed the action.                                                                 |
| Group            | User (member of the group) who performed the action.                                                                   |

| All              | Date range buttons and pickers (maximum range of 31 days). Default is from the first day of the month to today's date. |

## User impersonation

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/536) in GitLab 13.0.
> - Impersonation session events included in group audit events in GitLab 14.8.

When a user is [impersonated](../user/admin_area/index.md#user-impersonation), their actions are logged as audit events
with additional details:

- Audit events include information about the impersonating administrator. These audit events are visible in audit event
  pages depending on the audit event type (group, project, or user).
- Extra audit events are recorded for the start and end of the administrator's impersonation session. These audit events
  are visible as:
  - Instance audit events.
  - Group audit events for all groups the user belongs to. For performance reasons, group audit events are limited to
    the oldest 20 groups you belong to.

Instance events can also be accessed using the [Instance Audit Events API](../api/audit_events.md#instance-audit-events).

## "Deleted User" events

Audit events created after users are deleted are created for "Deleted User". For example, if a deleted user's access to
a project is removed automatically due to expiration.

Issue [343933](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343933) proposes to change this behavior.

## Unsupported events

Some events are not tracked in audit events. The following epics propose support for more events:

- [Project settings and activity](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/474).
- [Group settings and activity](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/475).
- [Instance-level settings and activity](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/476).

If you don't see the event you want in any of the epics, you can either:

- Use the **Audit Event Proposal** issue template to
  [create an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Audit%20Event%20Proposal) to
  request it.
- [Add it yourself](../development/audit_event_guide/index.md).
