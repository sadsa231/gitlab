    Support for third-party container registries is deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and will be [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/376217) in GitLab 16.0. Supporting both GitLab's Container Registry and third-party container registries is challenging for maintenance, code quality, and backward compatibility. This hinders our ability to stay [efficient](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#efficiency).

    Since we released the new [GitLab Container Registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5523) version for GitLab.com, we've started to implement additional features that are not available in third-party container registries. These new features have allowed us to achieve significant performance improvements, such as [cleanup policies](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8379). We are focusing on delivering [new features](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5136), most of which will require functionalities only available on the GitLab Container Registry. This deprecation allows us to reduce fragmentation and user frustration in the long term by focusing on delivering a more robust integrated registry experience and feature set.

    Moving forward, we'll continue to invest in developing and releasing new features that will only be available in the GitLab Container Registry.
