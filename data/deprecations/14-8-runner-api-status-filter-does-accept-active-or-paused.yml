    The GitLab Runner GraphQL endpoints will stop accepting `paused` or `active` as a status value in GitLab 16.0.

    A runner's status will only relate to runner contact status, such as: `online`, `offline`.
    Status values `paused` or `active` will no longer be accepted and will be replaced by the `paused` query parameter.

    When checking for paused runners, API users are advised to specify `paused: true` as the query parameter.
    When checking for active runners, specify `paused: false`.

    The REST API endpoints will follow in the same direction in a future REST v5 API, however the new `paused`
    status value can be used in place of `active` since GitLab 14.8.
