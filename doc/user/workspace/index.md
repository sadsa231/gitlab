# Organization

DISCLAIMER:

It is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only.

NOTE:
Organization is in development.

Organization will be above the [top-level namespaces](../namespace/index.md) for you to manage
everything you do as a GitLab administrator, including:

- Defining and applying settings to all of your groups, subgroups, and projects.
- Aggregating data from all your groups, subgroups, and projects.

Our goal is to reach feature parity between SaaS and self-managed installations, with all
[Admin Area settings](/ee/user/admin_area/settings/index.md) moving to either:

- Groups. Available in the Organization, and subgroups.
- Hardware Controls. For functionality that does not apply to groups, Hardware Controls are only
  applicable to self-managed installations. There is one Hardware Controls section per installation.
