# GitLab for Jira Cloud app **(FREE)**

You can integrate GitLab and Jira Cloud using the
[GitLab for Jira Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud)
app in the Atlassian Marketplace.

Only Jira users with administrator access can install or configure
the GitLab for Jira Cloud app.

## Install the GitLab for Jira Cloud app **(FREE SAAS)**

If you use GitLab.com and Jira Cloud, you can install the GitLab for Jira Cloud app.
If you do not use both of these environments, use the [Jira DVCS Connector](dvcs/index.md) or
[install the GitLab for Jira Cloud app manually](#install-the-gitlab-for-jira-cloud-app-manually).
We recommend the GitLab for Jira Cloud app, because data is
synchronized in real time. The DVCS connector updates data only once per hour.

To configure the GitLab for Jira Cloud app, you must have
at least the Maintainer role in the GitLab.com namespace.

This integration method supports [Smart Commits](dvcs/index.md#smart-commits).

[Configure GitLab.com Jira Could Integration using Marketplace App](https://youtu.be/SwR-g1s1zTo) on YouTube.

To install the GitLab for Jira Cloud app:

1. In Jira, go to **Jira Settings > Apps > Find new apps**, then search for GitLab.
1. Select **GitLab for Jira Cloud**, then select **Get it now**, or go to the
   [App in the marketplace directly](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud).

   ![Install GitLab.com app on Jira Cloud](img/jira_dev_panel_setup_com_1.png)
1. After installing, to go to the configurations page, select **Get started**.
   This page is always available under **Jira Settings > Apps > Manage apps**.

   ![Start GitLab.com app configuration on Jira Cloud](img/jira_dev_panel_setup_com_2.png)
1. To add namespaces, ensure you're signed in to GitLab.com
   as a user with at least the Maintainer role.

   ![Sign in to GitLab.com in GitLab for Jira Cloud app](img/jira_dev_panel_setup_com_3_v13_9.png)
1. To open the list of available namespaces, select **Add namespace**.

1. Identify the namespace you want to link, and select **Link**.
   - You must have at least the Maintainer role for the namespace.
   - Only Jira site administrators can add or remove namespaces for an installation.

   ![Link namespace in GitLab for Jira Cloud app](img/jira_dev_panel_setup_com_4_v13_9.png)

NOTE:
The GitLab.com user only needs access when adding a new namespace. For syncing with
Jira, we do not depend on the user's token.

After a namespace is added:

- All future commits, branches, and merge requests of all projects under that namespace
  are synced to Jira.
- From GitLab 13.8, past merge request data is synced to Jira.

Support for syncing past branch and commit data is tracked [in this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263240).

## Update the GitLab for Jira Cloud app

Most updates to the app are fully automated and don't require any user interaction. See the
[Atlassian Marketplace documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/upgrading-and-versioning-cloud-apps/)
for details.

If the app requires additional permissions, [the update must first be manually approved in Jira](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/upgrading-and-versioning-cloud-apps/#changes-that-require-manual-customer-approval).

## Set up OAuth authentication

The GitLab for Jira Cloud app is [switching to OAuth authentication](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387299).
To enable OAuth authentication, you must create an OAuth application on the GitLab instance.

Enabling OAuth authentication is:

- Required to [connect the GitLab for Jira Cloud app for self-managed instances](#connect-the-gitlab-for-jira-cloud-app-for-self-managed-instances).
- Recommended to [install the GitLab for Jira Cloud app manually](#install-the-gitlab-for-jira-cloud-app-manually).

To create an OAuth application:

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Applications** (`/admin/applications`).
1. Select **New application**.
1. In **Redirect URI**:
   - If you're installing the app from the official marketplace listing, enter `https://gitlab.com/-/jira_connect/oauth_callbacks`.
   - If you're installing the app manually, enter `<instance_url>/-/jira_connect/oauth_callbacks` and replace `<instance_url>` with the URL of your instance.
1. Clear the **Confidential** checkbox.
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD044 -->
1. In **Scopes**, select the **api** checkbox only.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD044 -->
1. Select **Save application**.
1. Copy the **Application ID** value.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > General** (`/admin/application_settings/general`).
1. Expand the **GitLab for Jira App** section.
1. Paste the **Application ID** value into **Jira Connect Application ID**.
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. Optional. Enable the `jira_connect_oauth` [feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) to avoid [authentication problems in some browsers](#browser-displays-a-sign-in-message-when-already-signed-in).

## Connect the GitLab for Jira Cloud app for self-managed instances **(FREE SELF)**

> Introduced in GitLab 15.7.

Prerequisites:

- GitLab.com must serve as a proxy for the instance.
- The instance must be publicly available.
- The instance must be on version 15.7 or later.

You can link self-managed instances after installing the GitLab for Jira Cloud app from the marketplace.
Jira apps can only link to one URL per marketplace listing. The official listing links to GitLab.com.

If your instance doesn't meet the prerequisites or you don't want to use the official marketplace listing, you can
[install the app manually](#install-the-gitlab-for-jira-cloud-app-manually).

It's not possible to create branches from Jira for self-managed instances.

### Set up your instance

To set up your self-managed instance for the GitLab for Jira Cloud app in GitLab 15.7 and later:

1. [Set up OAuth authentication](#set-up-oauth-authentication).
1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > General** (`/admin/application_settings/general`).
1. Expand the **GitLab for Jira App** section.
1. In **Jira Connect Proxy URL**, enter `https://gitlab.com`.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Link your instance

To link your self-managed instance to the GitLab for Jira Cloud app:

1. Install the [GitLab for Jira Cloud app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud?tab=overview&hosting=cloud).
1. Select **GitLab (self-managed)**.
1. Enter your GitLab instance URL.
1. Select **Save**.

## Install the GitLab for Jira Cloud app manually **(FREE SELF)**

If your GitLab instance is self-managed and you don't want to use the official marketplace listing,
you can install the app manually.

Prerequisites:

- The instance must be publicly available.
- You must set up [OAuth authentication](#set-up-oauth-authentication).

### Set up your Jira app

Each Jira Cloud application must be installed from a single location. Jira fetches
a [manifest file](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/connect-app-descriptor/)
from the location you provide. The manifest file describes the application to the system. To support
self-managed GitLab instances with Jira Cloud, you can do one of the following:

- [Install the application in development mode](#install-the-application-in-development-mode).
- [Create a Marketplace listing](#create-a-marketplace-listing).

#### Install the application in development mode

You can configure your Atlassian Cloud instance to allow you to install applications
from outside the Marketplace, which allows you to install the application:

1. Sign in to your Jira instance as an administrator.
1. Place your Jira instance into
   [development mode](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started-with-connect/#step-2--enable-development-mode).
1. Sign in to your GitLab application as a user with administrator access.
1. Install the GitLab application from your Jira instance, as
   described in the [Atlassian developer guides](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started-with-connect/#step-3--install-and-test-your-app):
   1. In your Jira instance, go to **Apps > Manage Apps** and select **Upload app**:

      ![Button labeled "upload app"](img/jira-upload-app_v13_11.png)

   1. For **App descriptor URL**, provide the full URL to your manifest file, based
      on your instance configuration. By default, your manifest file is located at `/-/jira_connect/app_descriptor.json`. For example, if your GitLab self-managed instance domain is `app.pet-store.cloud`, your manifest file is located at `https://app.pet-store.cloud/-/jira_connect/app_descriptor.json`.
   1. Select **Upload**. Jira fetches the content of your `app_descriptor` file and installs
      it.
   1. If the upload is successful, Jira displays a modal panel: **Installed and ready to go!**
      To configure the integration, select **Get started**.

      ![Success modal](img/jira-upload-app-success_v13_11.png)

1. Disable [development mode](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started-with-connect/#step-2--enable-development-mode) on your Jira instance.

The **GitLab for Jira Cloud** app now displays under **Manage apps**. You can also
select **Get started** to open the configuration page rendered from your GitLab instance.

NOTE:
If a GitLab update makes changes to the application descriptor, you must uninstall,
then reinstall the application.

#### Create a Marketplace listing

If you prefer to not use development mode on your Jira instance, you can create
your own Marketplace listing for your instance. This enables your application
to be installed from the Atlassian Marketplace.

For full instructions, review the Atlassian [guide to creating a marketplace listing](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/installing-cloud-apps/#creating-the-marketplace-listing).
To create a Marketplace listing:

1. Register as a Marketplace vendor.
1. List your application using the application descriptor URL.
   - Your manifest file is located at: `https://your.domain/your-path/-/jira_connect/app_descriptor.json`
   - We recommend you list your application as `private`, because public
     applications can be viewed and installed by any user.
1. Generate test license tokens for your application.

NOTE:
This method uses [automated updates](#update-the-gitlab-for-jira-cloud-app)
the same way as our GitLab.com Marketplace listing.

## Troubleshooting

### Browser displays a sign-in message when already signed in

You might get the following message prompting you to sign in to GitLab.com
when you're already signed in:

```plaintext
You need to sign in or sign up before continuing.
```

The GitLab for Jira Cloud app uses an iframe to add namespaces on the
settings page. Some browsers block cross-site cookies, which can lead to this issue.

To resolve this issue, set up [OAuth authentication](#set-up-oauth-authentication) and enable the `jira_connect_oauth` [feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md).

### Manual installation fails

You might get an error if you have installed the GitLab for Jira Cloud app from the official marketplace listing and replaced it with manual installation. To resolve this issue, disable the **Jira Connect Proxy URL** setting.

- In GitLab 15.7:

  1. Open a [Rails console](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
  1. Execute `ApplicationSetting.current_without_cache.update(jira_connect_proxy_url: nil)`.

- In GitLab 15.8 and later:

  1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Admin**.
  1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > General** (`/admin/application_settings/general`).
  1. Expand the **GitLab for Jira App** section.
  1. Clear the **Jira Connect Proxy URL** text box.
  1. Select **Save changes**.
