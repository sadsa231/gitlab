    The support for registration tokens and certain configuration arguments in the command to [register](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/) a runner, `gitlab-runner register` is deprecated.
    GitLab plans to introduce a new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/) in GitLab 15.8,
    which introduces a new method for registering runners and eliminates the legacy
    [runner registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#runner-registration-tokens).
    The new method will involve creating the runner in the GitLab UI and passing the
    [runner authentication token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#runner-authentication-tokens-also-called-runner-tokens)
    to the `gitlab-runner register` command.
  end_of_support_milestone: "16.0"  # (optional) Use "XX.YY" format. The milestone when support for this feature will end.
