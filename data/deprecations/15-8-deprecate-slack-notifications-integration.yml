    As we're consolidating all Slack capabilities into the
    GitLab for Slack app, we're [deprecating the Slack Notifications
    integration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372411).
    GitLab.com users can now use the GitLab for Slack app to manage notifications
    to their Slack workspace. For self-managed users of the Slack Notifications integration,
    we'll be introducing support in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1211).
