  body: |
    The endpoint to get [changes from a single merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html#get-single-merge-request-changes) has been deprecated in favor the [list merge request diffs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html#list-merge-request-diffs) endpoint. API users are encouraged to switch to the new diffs endpoint instead. The `changes from a single merge request` endpoint will be removed in v5 of the GitLab REST API.
