    All functionality related to the GitLab Container Network Security and Container Host Security categories was deprecated in GitLab 14.8 and scheduled for removal in GitLab 15.0. The [CiliumNetworkPolicy definition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image/-/blob/master/assets/auto-deploy-app/values.yaml#L175) that exists as part of the [GitLab Auto Deploy Helm chart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image/-/tree/master/assets/auto-deploy-app) was not removed as scheduled in GitLab 15.0. This policy is planned to be removed in the GitLab 15.8 release.

    If you want to preserve this functionality, you can follow one of these two paths:

    1. Fork the [GitLab Auto Deploy Helm chart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image/-/tree/master/assets/auto-deploy-app) into the `chart/` path within your project
    1. Set `AUTO_DEPLOY_IMAGE_VERSION` and `DAST_AUTO_DEPLOY_IMAGE_VERSION` to the most recent version of the image that included the CiliumNetworkPolicy
