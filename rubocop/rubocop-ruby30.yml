# RuboCop configuration adjustments during the transition time from Ruby 2.7 to Ruby 3.0.
# This configuration should be removed after the transition has been completed.

# Disable cops for now since their behavior changed in Ruby 3.0.
# See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/jobs/3068345492
#
# Migration plan:
# * Generate TODOs for these cops (with Ruby 3.0) right before the switch to Ruby 3.0
# * Put these cops back in "grace period" to ensure `master` stability
# * Remove "grace period" after the switch
# * Incrementally fix TODOs
