This document is a work-in-progress and represents a very early state of the
Pods design. Significant aspects are not documented, though we expect to add
them in the future. This is one possible architecture for Pods, and we intend to
contrast this with alternatives before deciding which approach to implement.
This documentation will be kept even if we decide not to implement this so that
we can document the reasons for not choosing this approach.

# Pods: Router Endpoints Classification

Classification of all endpoints is essential to properly route request
hitting load balancer of a GitLab installation to a Pod that can serve it.

Each Pod should be able to decode each request and classify for which Pod
it belongs to.

GitLab currently implements hundreds of endpoints. This document tries
to describe various techniques that can be implemented to allow the Rails
to provide this information efficiently.
