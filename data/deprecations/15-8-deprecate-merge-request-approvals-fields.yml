    The endpoint to get the configuration of approvals for a project returns empty arrays for `approvers` and `approval_groups`. These fields were deprecated in favor of the endpoint to [get project-level rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_request_approvals.html#get-project-level-rules) for a merge request. API users are encouraged to switch to this endpoint instead. These fields will be removed from the `get configuration` endpoint in v5 of the GitLab REST API.
