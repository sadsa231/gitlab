  body: |
    As of November 22, 2022, we have removed support for customers using NFS for Git repository storage. This was
    originally planned for May 22, 2022, but in an effort to allow continued maturity of Gitaly Cluster, we delayed
    our removal of support date until now. Please see our official [Statement of Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#gitaly-and-nfs)
    for further information.

    This change in support follows the development deprecation for NFS for Git repository storage that occurred in GitLab 14.0.

    Gitaly Cluster offers tremendous benefits for our customers such as:

    - [Variable replication factors](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#replication-factor).
    - [Strong consistency](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#strong-consistency).
    - [Distributed read capabilities](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#distributed-reads).

    We encourage customers currently using NFS for Git repositories to migrate as soon as possible by reviewing our documentation on
    [migrating to Gitaly Cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#migrate-to-gitaly-cluster).
