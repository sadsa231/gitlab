    When creating and updating users through the API, `null` was a valid value for the `private_profile` attribute, which would internally be converted to the default value. Starting with 16.0, `null` will no longer be a valid value for this parameter, and the response will be a 400 if used. Now the only valid values are `true` and `false`.
