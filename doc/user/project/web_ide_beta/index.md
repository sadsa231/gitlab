# Web IDE Beta **(FREE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/95169) in GitLab 15.7 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `vscode_web_ide`. Disabled by default.

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is not available. To make it available, ask an administrator to [enable the feature flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `vscode_web_ide`. On GitLab.com, this feature is available. The feature is not ready for production use.

As announced in [this blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/05/23/the-future-of-the-gitlab-web-ide/),
the current implementation of the [Web IDE](../web_ide/index.md) is being replaced
with an implementation powered by Visual Studio Code. This effort is still under
development. For updates, see [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7683).

To pair the Web IDE Beta with a Remote Development environment, see [Remote Development](../remote_development/index.md).
