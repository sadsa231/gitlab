# Tasks **(FREE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334812) in GitLab 14.5 [with a flag](../administration/feature_flags.md) named `work_items`. Disabled by default.
> - [Creating, editing, and deleting tasks](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7169) introduced in GitLab 15.0.
> - [Enabled on GitLab.com and self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334812) in GitLab 15.3.

For the latest updates, check the [Tasks Roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7103).

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is available. To hide the feature,

On GitLab.com, this feature is available.

Use tasks to track steps needed for the [issue](project/issues/index.md) to be closed.

When planning an issue, you need a way to capture and break down technical
requirements or steps necessary to complete it. An issue with related tasks is better defined,
and so you can provide a more accurate issue weight and completion criteria.

Tasks are a type of work item, a step towards [default issue types](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323404)
in GitLab.
For the roadmap of migrating issues and [epics](group/epics/index.md)
to work items and adding custom work item types, see
[epic 6033](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6033) or the
[Plan direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/).
