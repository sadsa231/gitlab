# Merge request analytics **(PREMIUM)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/229045) in GitLab 13.3.
> - Moved to GitLab Premium in 13.9.

Use merge request analytics to view:

- The number of merge requests your organization merged per month.
- The average time between merge request creation and merge event.
- Information about each merged merge request (such as milestone, commits, line changes, and assignees).

You can use merge request analytics to identify:

- Low or high productivity months.
- The efficiency and productivity of your merge request and code review processes.
